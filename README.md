# Hi, I'm Niharika Srivastava 👋 Full-Stack Engineer → AI/ML Developer 

🎓 MSc Artificial Intelligence @ University of Southampton (2025-26)
💼 9+ years as Senior Software Engineer (Genpact, Capgemini, Sopra Steria)
🔄 Transitioning from Full-Stack Development → AI/ML Engineering

I build things that work at scale — and now I'm teaching machines to do the same.

# What I Bring to the Table
I've spent nearly a decade shipping production software for Fortune 500 companies — serverless architectures on AWS, real-time systems for aerospace (Airbus), cloud migrations for global insurers (Liberty Mutual), and micro-frontend platforms for Japan's largest e-commerce company (Rakuten). Now I'm combining that engineering muscle with formal AI/ML training to build intelligent systems that are actually production-ready.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**AI/ML:** Python | TensorFlow | Keras | scikit-learn | PyTorch | NLP | Deep Learning
**Backend:** Node.js | Express | Python | REST APIs | GraphQL
**Frontend:** Angular | React | TypeScript | Redux
**Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, Aurora) | Docker | CI/CD
**Databases:** MongoDB | MySQL | PostgreSQL | Elasticsearch

## 🎯 Current Focus
- Deep Learning for sensor data & time-series analysis
- MLOps and model deployment pipelines
- Bridging the gap between ML research and production systems
- Transformer architectures and attention mechanisms
🗣️ Natural Language Processing and text understanding
🔗 Knowledge Graphs for AI reasoning
